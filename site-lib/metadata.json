google sheet and update the ones that have changed\nIt can create a new file if a row has been added\nIt will also copy the Character Icon template to prevent image template loading issues I can update the file template with a python script, meaning any data that is after the template can be saved while still modifying the template for all the Character files\nSafety Features: Backup Creation: Before modifying or deleting frontmatter or templates, it would be good practice to create a backup of each markdown file. This way, if an error occurs during the process (or in case of unintended changes), you can easily roll back. Implementation: Create a Backups folder where a timestamped copy of each file is saved before making changes. Validation Before Overwriting: When syncing from Google Sheets, you should validate that the data is correct before overwriting the frontmatter in the markdown files. This could include checks for missing fields, invalid data types, or malformed entries. Implementation: Add a validation step to the Python script that checks for inconsistencies between the Google Sheet data and the expected format. Dry Run Mode: Implement a \"dry run\" feature in your Python script that will show what changes will be made without actually executing them. This allows you to verify the proposed changes before applying them to the files. Transaction-Like Operation: Ensure that your script performs changes atomically, so if there’s an error partway through an operation (e.g., a failure to copy an image or a permission issue), it rolls back to the original state. Log All Changes: Keep a log of all changes made by your Python script. This could be useful for debugging and tracking what was updated, deleted, or created. Additional Functionality Suggestions: Template Versioning: Implement a version control for your templates. This way, if a template is updated, your script can detect which version is being used in each file and update accordingly, without overwriting custom changes users may have made within individual notes. Automatic Image Resizing/Optimization: When copying the Character Icon template, ensure that the images are optimized for web display (e.g., smaller file size for faster loading). If the original image is too large, consider automatically resizing or compressing it. Sync Status Dashboard: Create a simple dashboard or log output within Obsidian that tracks the sync status for each character file. This can show whether each file is up to date with the latest Google Sheets data, needs updating, or encountered issues during syncing. Conflict Handling: If two users are working on the same file (e.g., modifying the Google Sheet and the Obsidian note simultaneously), your script should have conflict detection and resolution mechanisms (e.g., alerting you to manually review changes).\nCopy","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Am I missing a feature","level":1,"id":"Am I missing a
